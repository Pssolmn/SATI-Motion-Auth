### ⚠️ Prototype & Concept Release
**Note:** This project is currently a **Proof-of-Concept (PoC)** prototype designed to demonstrate the potential of **Motion Authentication**. It is not yet a production-ready banking application but serves as a functional demo to showcase how sensor-based security can prevent remote fraud.

## 📱 Why SATI? (The Problem with Biometrics)
In the age of remote access scams, standard biometrics (Fingerprint/FaceID) are no longer enough.
* **The Problem:** Biometrics rely on **Muscle Memory**. We tap without thinking. If a scammer is remotely controlling your screen, you might unconsciously authenticate out of habit.
* **The Solution:** SATI demands **Active Physical Interaction**. By forcing the user to perform specific, random physical actions (shaking, tilting, rotating), we create a **"Mindful Pause."** This breaks the victim's trance and makes it technically impossible for a remote hacker to bypass the security, as they cannot physically move the victim's device.

## 🚀 Current Demo Features
The current `.apk` demonstrates the core philosophy with these working modules:
* **🚫 Anti-Remote Shield:** Automatically detects remote control tools/screen recording and blacks out the screen (`FLAG_SECURE`).
* **👋 Shake-to-Verify:** Utilizes the Accelerometer and Gyroscope to verify physical presence.
* **💣 Time-Bomb Challenge:** A 20-second countdown interface to create urgency for legitimate users while blocking slow remote attackers.
* **🔒 Persistence Lockout:** Smart cool-down system to prevent brute-force attacks.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap: The "SATI" Ecosystem
We are developing a suite of sensor-based authentication methods to replace traditional PINs and Biometrics for high-security transactions:

### 1. 🎨 Gesture & Shape Recognition
Instead of tapping a static PIN pad (which can be screen-recorded), the user draws a specific shape or "Imperfect Pattern" on the screen. The system recognizes the unique stroke and shape, making it harder for bots to replicate.

### 2. 🔐 The Gyroscope Vault (Safe Dial)
Turning the smartphone into a virtual bank vault dial. The user must rotate their wrist (Z-axis) clockwise and counter-clockwise to specific degrees to unlock, using haptic feedback as a guide. Impossible to "shoulder surf."

### 3. 🔦 Light Sensor Tapping
Using the ambient light sensor to detect specific "tapping" rhythms (like Morse code) against the phone's receiver. A discreet way to unlock the phone in dark environments without touching the screen.

### 4. 🗣️ Catchphrase & Rhythm Unlock
Verifying identity through a combination of voice stress analysis and tapping rhythms, ensuring the user is not under duress.
